#### Tutorial: How to Build a Simple React Native App

In this tutorial, we will use React Native to create simple Android and iOS apps for Trip Revisorâ€”an app for researching holiday destinations. The apps will be fairly simple. The home screen will let you choose from a selection of cities, each option having some photos and text. The React components will be translated to native components, giving our app a silky smooth feel. The text and photo URLs will be fetched from our Meteor server, and you'll see just how easy it is to connect an app to your existing Meteor backend.
